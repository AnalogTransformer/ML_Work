Practical 7
Dr Simon Denman
CAB420: Machine Learning
This weeks practical will focus on Siamese networks and how these can be used to compare
things.
Problem 1. Deep Face Recognition. Using the YaleB 32x32.mat data, train a Siamese
network to match faces of the same subject. In doing this you should:
1. Determine your network architecture, i.e. pairs or triplets, and loss formulation. You
may also wish to fine tune an existing network.
2. Implement (or modify) an appropriate method to generate pairs/triplets of images,
and verify that this is generating pairs/triplets as expected.
Using your trained network, evaluate it and compare the performance to the PCA and
LDA approaches from last week. Note that you can train a CKNN classifier to replicate the
functionality of last weekâ€™s approaches by:
1. Passing each image through the network to generate an embedding;
2. Applying CKNN to the embeddings.
As per last week, evaluate the performance on the Yale and ORL datasets.
